this test case ensures that the function handles out of bounds input
Expected output:returns 0
4.the coordinate passed is an alphabit(corresponds to a column)
this ensures that the function correctly handles column coordinates .Calls the TorCol function to fire at the given column
Expected output:firing at the corresponding column according to the TorCol Function.Returns 1
5.the coordinate passed is an a digit(corresponds to a row)
this ensures that the function correctly handles row coordinates .Calls the TorRow function to fire at the given row
Expected output:firing at the corresponding row according to the TorCol Function.Returns 1
6.the coordinate passed is an edge coordinate (e.g torpedo 10)
this ensures that the function can handle boundary input
Expected output :fireing at the corresponding row(if digit) or column(if alphabit) according to the TorRow or TorCol functions respectively.Returns 1

RadarSweep function
Test Cases:
1.radarSweepsused>3 (number of times rader sweep was used is more than 3)
This test case ensures that the function doesn't use a locked move
Expected output:prints :"You have used all your radar sweeps",and returns 0
2.the coordinate passed is out of bounds (e.g Radar X1)
This test case ensures that the function out of bounds coordinates
Expected Output :prints "Invalid coordinate" ,and returns 0
3.an arbitrary coordinate is passed (e.g radar A3)
this test case ensures that the function correctly handles valid input within a 2x2 area (A3,A4,B3,B4)
Expected output:if at least one of the slots contains part of a ship prints:"Enemy ships found", else prints :"No enemy ships found", and returns 1
4.The smokeGrid provided contains ones at the exact coordinates passed to the function
this ensures that the function doesn't report any ships found within the 2x2 area were smokescreen was deployed by the opponent 
Expected output:prints "No enemy ships found", and returns 1
5.The smokeGrid provided contains ones at coordinates other than the ones passed 
This ensures that the function correctly reports any ships found, even if the smoke screen has been used by the opponent, as long as they are not located at the coordinates passed
Expected Output: if at least one of the slots contains part of a ship prints:"Enemy ships found", else prints :"No enemy ships found", and returns 1
6.The SmokeGrid passed conatins ones along some of the coordinates passed 
this ensures that the function correctly reports ship found within the 2x2 area of the coordinates that aren't  covered by the smoke screen 
Expected output :if at least one of the uncovered slots  contains part of a ship prints:"Enemy ships found", else prints :"No enemy ships found", and returns 1
// idk if i shoud mention edge coordinate since if we put A1 it works but J1 it shouldn't perform however in out code we dont handle the case

SmokeScreen function
Test Cases:
1.SmokeScreenUsed>shipsSunk(number of time the smoke screen is used is greater than the number of ships sunk by the current player)
This ensures that the function doesn't deploy smoke screen when it is still locked 
Expected output:prints "You can't use smoke screen",and returns 0
2.the coordinate passed is out of bounds
this esures that the function handles out fo bound coordinates
Expected output:"Invalid coordinates",and returns 0
3.arbitary coordinates are passed 
this ensures that the function correctly deployes smoke screen along the 2x2 area at the specified coordinate
Expected output:fills the smokeGrid with 1's at the specified 2x2 area ,prints :"Smoke screen deployed succssfully","Press Enter to continue", clears console ,and return 1
// idk if i shoud mention edge coordinate since if we put A1 it works but J1 it shouldn't perform however in out code we dont handle the case

artillery Function
Test Cases:
1.pass as an argument flag = 0
This case ensures that function correctly handle the case when move is locked.
Expected Output: Prints: "You cannot use this move yet. Sink one ship of your opponent in the current turn to unlock it for the next turn."
2.Pass as an argument coordinate of cell(row,col) that is out of bounds (either row or column, or both):
This case ensures that the function correctly handles out-of-bounds coordinates.
Expected Output: Prints: "Invalid input!"
3.pass as an argument flag = 1, mode = 'easy,' and a valid  2x2 grid 
This case ensures that function correctly fires at the 2x2 grid and represents hits with * and misses with o.
Expected Output: If at least one cell in the grid is hit, prints: "HIT". Otherwise, prints: "MISS".
3.pass as an argument flag = 1, mode = 'hard' and a valid  2x2 grid
This case ensures that the function correctly fires at the 2x2 grid, representing only hits with * (misses are not represented ).
Expected Output: If at least one cell in the grid is hit, prints: "HIT". Otherwise, prints: "MISS".
4.pass as an argument  flag i= 1, any mode (easy or hard), and the 2x2 grid is invalid (one cell out of bounds):
This case ensures that the function correctly handles invalid grids.
Expected Output: Prints: "Invalid input/area is out of bounds."

canPlaceShip Function
Test Cases:
1.Pass  as an argument  the player’s grid with a either  directions Horizontal(H) or Vertical(V) and legal coordinates (within bounds and without overlap):
This test case ensures  that the function correctly handles coordinates that are neither out of bounds nor overlapping.
Expected Output: Returns 1, indicating that the ship can be placed at this cell.
2.Pass  as an argument the player’s grid with  either  directions Horizontal(H) or Vertical(V) and coordinates that violate boundary constraints (out of bounds):
This case ensures that the function correctly handles coordinates that are out of bounds.
Expected Output: Returns -1, indicating that the ship cannot be placed at this cell.
3.Pass  as an argument the player’s grid with a direction (Horizontal or Vertical) and coordinates that overlap with other ships:
This case ensures that the function correctly handles overlapping coordinates.
Expected Output: Returns -1, indicating that the ship cannot be placed at this cell.


ShipsSunk Function:
Test cases :
1.Case when there is no ship sunk 
this case  ensure that the counter will not be incrmented
Expected Output: return number of ship sunk (same as before)
2.case when a ship is sunk (its value is 0)
this case ensure that the function will set its size to -1 and increment count of sunk ships.
Expected Output: return number of sunk ships (incremented by one)and prints a statment stating which ship is sunk

Row Function:
Test cases :
1.case when row is out of bounds ( row<1||row>10)
this case ensure that function correctly handles case when row out of bounds.
Expected Output = return -1 
2.case when row is within bounds(row>=1||row<=10)
this case ensure that function will correctly calculate and convert the  value of row  to be used late on (row-1)
Expected Output:return numerical value of row -1

Col Function:
Test cases :
1.case when column is out of bounds ( col>J)
this case ensure that function correctly handles case when col out of bounds.
Expected Output = return -1 
2.case when col is within bounds(col>=A||col<=J)
this case ensure that function will correctly  convert and calculate the value of column to be used later on.
Expected Output:return numerical value representing  column
