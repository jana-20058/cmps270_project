# Battle Ship Game Bot Against A player
#Discription
The Battleship Game Bot is a strategic game where a bot plays against a human player. The players place his ships (Destroyer, Carrier, Submarine, Battleship) on a 10x10 grid. The goal is to sink all of the botâ€™s ships before it sinks yours. It is a turn-based game. In this repository we recreate a terminal version of this game.
